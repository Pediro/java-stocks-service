As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once servedâ€¦ and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day."},"difficult":{"N":"5"},"price":{"N":"3150"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"syndra"},"tags":{"SS":["Mage"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Syndra_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Syndra_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Syndra is a fearsome Ionian mage with incredible power at her command.

Though he may appear singularly charming and proud, he swaggers through the physical realm like a vagabond in search of unsuspecting prey. His lashing tongue can stun even a heavily armored warrior from a dozen paces, and to fall into his rumbling belly is to tumble into an abyss from which there is little hope of return."},"difficult":{"N":"5"},"price":{"N":"4800"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"taliyah"},"tags":{"SS":["Mage","Support"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Taliyah_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Taliyah_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Taliyah is a nomadic mage from Shurima, torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility. She has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers, though more recently she has returned to protect her tribe. Some have mistaken her compassion for weakness and paid the ultimate priceâ€”for beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth itself tremble."},"difficult":{"N":"5"},"price":{"N":"4800"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"talon"},"tags":{"SS":["Assassin"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Talon_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Talon_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Talon is the knife in the darkness, a merciless killer able to strike without warning and escape before any alarm is raised. He carved out a dangerous reputation on the brutal streets of Noxus, where he was forced to fight, kill, and steal to survive. Adopted by the notorious Du Couteau family, he now plies his deadly trade at the empire's command, assassinating enemy leaders, captains, and heroesâ€¦ as well as any Noxian foolish enough to earn the scorn of their masters."},"difficult":{"N":"7"},"price":{"N":"3150"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"taric"},"tags":{"SS":["Support","Fighter"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Taric_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Taric_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Taric is the Aspect of the Protector, wielding incredible power as Runeterra's guardian of life, love, and beauty.

A yordle with an unwavering sense of morality, he takes pride in following the Bandle Scout's Code, sometimes with such eagerness that he is unaware of the broader consequences of his actions. Though some say the existence of the Scouts is questionable, one thing is for certain: Teemo's conviction is nothing to be trifled with."},"difficult":{"N":"6"},"price":{"N":"450"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"thresh"},"tags":{"SS":["Support","Fighter"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Thresh_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Thresh_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is an ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles.

She had heard much about Runeterra, its factions, and its wars, and believed her kind could become worthy of legend too. Setting foot in the world for the first time, she took up her trusty cannon Boomer, and now leaps into battle with steadfast courage and optimism."},"difficult":{"N":"4"},"price":{"N":"1350"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"trundle"},"tags":{"SS":["Fighter","Tank"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Trundle_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Trundle_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Trundle is a hulking and devious troll with a particularly vicious streak, and there is nothing he cannot bludgeon into submissionâ€”not even the Freljord itself.

He seeks balance within, so that his mind does not get lost amidst others, but he also seeks balance withoutâ€”for the Freljord's mystical landscape can only thrive with the growth that comes from conflict and struggle, and Udyr knows that sacrifices must be made to keep peaceful stagnance at bay."},"difficult":{"N":"7"},"price":{"N":"1350"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"urgot"},"tags":{"SS":["Fighter","Tank"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Urgot_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Urgot_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"Once a powerful Noxian headsman, Urgot was betrayed by the empire for which he had killed so many.

Now a stubborn creature with an endless fascination for the mysteries of the universe, Veigar is often underestimated by othersâ€”but even though he believes himself truly evil, he possesses an inner morality that leads some to question his deeper motivations."},"difficult":{"N":"7"},"price":{"N":"1350"}}}},{"PutRequest":{"Item":{"name":{"S":"velkoz"},"tags":{"SS":["Mage"]},"coverImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Velkoz_0.jpg"},"thumbnailImage":{"S":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/loading/Velkoz_0.jpg"},"description":{"S":"It is unclear if Vel'Koz was the first Void-spawn to emerge on Runeterra, but there has certainly never been another to match his level of cruel, calculating sentience. While his kin devour or defile everything around them, he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical realmâ€”and the strange, warlike beings that dwell thereâ€”for any weakness the Void might exploit.
